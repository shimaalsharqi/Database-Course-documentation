1. Comparison Between Flat File Systems and Relational Databases

Flat File Systems and Relational Databases are both used for storing data, but they differ greatly in structure, redundancy handling, relationships, usage, and limitations. The following sections provide a detailed comparison.

Structure

Flat File Systems:
Store data in simple text-based formats such as CSV or TXT. Records are listed sequentially, and there is no concept of tables, schemas, or defined relationships.

Relational Databases:
Organize data into structured tables (rows and columns). They use primary keys and foreign keys to define relationships and enforce data integrity.

Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems:
High redundancy because the same data may be repeated across multiple files. There is no built-in mechanism to avoid duplication.

Relational Databases:
Redundancy is reduced through normalization techniques, which split data into related tables to avoid duplication and maintain consistency.

Relationships

Flat File Systems:
Relationships are either implicit or manually duplicated. There is no formal system to link records between files.

Relational Databases:
Support explicit and well-defined relationships, such as:

One-to-One (1–1)

One-to-Many (1–M)

Many-to-Many (M–M)
These are enforced using primary and foreign keys.

Example Usage

Flat File Systems:
Used for simple or temporary data storage such as:

CSV lists

Log files

Small datasets that do not require complex querying

Relational Databases:
Used for large-scale systems that require structured data and complex operations, such as:

Student registration systems

Banking systems

E-commerce applications

Enterprise applications and web systems

Drawbacks

Flat File Systems:

Hard to maintain

No support for complex queries

Weak security

Higher chance of data inconsistency or corruption

Relational Databases:

More complex to design and manage

May require licensing costs

Require more storage and processing resources

Need regular maintenance

Roles in a Database System
| Role                | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System Analyst      | Responsible for gathering business requirements and analyzing organizational needs. Designs processes |
|                     | and ensures that the database system aligns with business goals.                                      |
| Database Designer   | Creates the logical and physical database models. Applies normalization and defines entities,         |
|                     | attributes, relationships, and constraints to ensure proper structure.                                |
| Database Developer  | Develops SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and views. Ensures efficient data manipulation,    |
|                     | integration, and supports application requirements.                                                   |
| DBA (Administrator) | Manages database performance, security, backups, and recovery. Responsible for installation, tuning,  |
|                     | user management, and ongoing maintenance of the DBMS.                                                 |
| Application Developer| Builds applications and interfaces that interact with the database. Works with APIs, backend logic,  |
|                      | and ensures proper communication between the system and the DBMS.                                     |
| BI Developer        | Converts raw data into meaningful insights through reports, dashboards, and analytics. Performs ETL   |
|                     | processes and works with data warehouses and business intelligence tools.                             |



Types of Databases
1. Relational vs Non-Relational Databases
Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Relational databases store data in structured tables with rows and columns. They use SQL for querying and rely on primary and foreign keys to define relationships between tables.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle.
Best for: transactional systems, financial data, student systems, ERP, applications requiring strong consistency.

Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

Non-relational databases do not follow a strict tabular structure. They store data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.
Examples:

Document Store → MongoDB

Wide Column Store → Cassandra

Key-Value → Redis

Graph → Neo4j
Best for: large-scale distributed systems, real-time analytics, content management, IoT, social networks.

2. Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases
Centralized Database

A centralized database is stored and managed on a single central server. All users access the same location.
Advantages: easy to manage, strong security control, consistent data.
Disadvantages: single point of failure, performance bottlenecks.

Distributed Database

A distributed database stores data across multiple servers or locations. These servers work together but may be geographically separated.
Advantages: high availability, faster access for global users, fault tolerance.
Disadvantages: more complex management, data synchronization challenges.
Examples: Google Bigtable, Cassandra (distributed by design).

Cloud Databases

Hosted on cloud platforms and accessed over the internet. Managed by cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.
Advantages: scalable, pay-as-you-go pricing, automated backups and updates.
Disadvantages: depends on internet connectivity, potential privacy concerns.
Examples:

Azure SQL Database

Amazon RDS

Google Cloud Spanner

| Social media platforms          | Non-Relational (NoSQL – document/graph) | Handles massive unstructured data and high scalability |
| Global e-commerce platform      | Distributed or Cloud Database      | High availability and fast access for users worldwide          |
| IoT sensor data                 | NoSQL (wide column or key-value)   | Supports rapid data ingestion from large numbers of devices    |
| University or HR system         | Relational Database                | Structured data with well-defined relationships                |
